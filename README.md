🔥 PostgreSQL Trigger

A database-level trigger is executed after a booking is inserted:

-- Pseudo trigger example:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_bill()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO billing(booking_id, amount, generated_at)
  VALUES (
    NEW.id,
    calculate_total(NEW.room_id, NEW.check_in, NEW.check_out),
    NOW()
  );
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER after_booking_insert
AFTER INSERT ON bookings
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION generate_bill();

> Note: `calculate_total()` would be a custom function to compute the amount based on room price and stay duration.
